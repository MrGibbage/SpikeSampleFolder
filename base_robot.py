class BaseRobot():

    A collection of methods and Spike Prime objects for FLL Team 24277. \
    The BaseRobot class has two drive motors as a MotorPair, two medium \
    motors for moving attachments, and all of the base methods available for \
    Spike Prime sensors and motors. It also includes some custom methods \
    for moving the robot. Enjoy!

            to the left. Note that when the robot makes the turn, it will \
            always overshoot by about seven degrees. In other words if you \
            need a +90 degree turn, you will probably end up commanding \
            something around +83 degrees. You may also want to put a \

        Parameter
        -------------

        desiredDegrees: How many degrees should the robot turn. \

        type: float
        values: Any. Best to keep the numbers less than 180, just so the \
            robot doesn't turn more than necessary.
